15 Port Limit

A USB Port Limit Patch is required if you have more
than 15 USB ports per controller... Each OS update
may require a new port limit patch. Disable the
ports you aren't using by removing them from
USBPortInjector.kext/Contents/Info.plist

Example:

If you are not using the internal 2.0 ports, then
removing HS05,HS06,HS11,HS12,HS13,HS14 = 14 ports.

Any port limit patch can then also be removed
